I felt the skills that I gained from Coursera were not sufficient to make me an efficient Web Developer. Then I started digging into online live courses for coding schools which provide Full Stack Development and I came across Masai School. As a result from an Electronics and Communication Engineer I felt I should start my career in web development, currently I'm pursuing MERN stack at Masai School at Bangalore, Karnataka. I've sound experience in Front-end and Back-end development using MERN stack. With the hands on practice at Masai School and developing various projects gave me an insight to my coding knowledge and also increased my confidence to go to the next level.

For me the best part of developing software is learning problem domains. My career began working on accounting, invoicing and inventory control systems for medium sized businesses primarily in West Michigan. We served trucking companies, tool & die makers, laundry, paint stores, and many others. Along the way computers became networked and personal. I learned networks, object oriented design and distributed systems. * My career has trended up, crashed and crawled back up. My first title was computer programmer. Back then programming a computer was a big deal. To a certain extent it still is. I have the knack. Software developers know what that knack is, but we are at a loss to explain what it is. I worked at Osterbaan Consultants (my Dad's company) for 17 years. I left to work for our then largest customer in 1999. After Y2K and converting to an outsourced computer system I was laid off. I was unemployed for a period then under employed. I worked as a carpenter. There I learned two key lessons. There are many honorable trades with highly skilled people doing them. There are about 3 perfect weather days a year in Michigan to work outside. I worked on a siding crew. The intense intentional teamwork environment there impresses me to this day. I worked as an apprentice electrician for a year. I focused on installing Motorola Canopy family of high speed internet equipment because I had previous networking experience. I was also trained in new residential, commercial, and remodeling electrical work. Finally I was hired in at Smith's Aerospace (later acquired by GE) as a lab specialist. I finished my Master's degree and eventually moved up to a software developer role. Here I've learned software engineering and aerospace quality."

Building a solution that really solves a problem for people and that's easy to use, that's what sets apart your application from the crowd.

Thanks to that mindset, I was able to get through college successfully, as well as progress as a person and a programmer. My interest in software engineering first began during my high school days. I loved learning about the newest technology in cellphones during the time, whether it be related to hardware or software. This encouraged me to major in Electrical & Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. During my four years at UT Austin, I gained a great amount of experience while working on various types of projects— such as a mini video game and an information database website. My personal favorite was a 2-semester long Capstone Design project where 5 students and I worked together to build a pair of gloves that would translate American Sign Language in real-time. Throughout the course, we brainstormed what type of sensors would be needed, researched existing patents/projects to gather more ideas and ensure we were not copying them, built and tested the glove & website, and finished off by successfully demoing the project. Many people choose to focus on their positive experiences, but I feel that it is important to give attention to the negative parts as well. I dealt with failures throughout the four years, which also slowed down my progress a couple of times. I took on this challenge of getting myself back on track and worked hard to get myself to where I am today. I keep a determined mindset with everything I do and stay positive even during the toughest problems. Since I have graduated from college, I have not stopped educating myself and improving my existing skills. I truly believe that, no matter what stage in life I'm currently in, I'm always learning something new. Now that I've joined General Motors as a Software Developer, I look forward to being able to work on new projects, expose myself to different technology, and learn from my peers!"

I am working in a cloud development group, using Microsoft Azure.

I formerly owned Echo Coffee an independent coffee shop in south Scottsdale.  At Echo, I employed a team of talented baristas, and an amazing chef, and together, we provided what was (and still is) widely regarded as the best coffee shop in Scottsdale. Previously, I worked for 6 years as a real estate agent with Realty Executives, where it was my goal to help clients accomplish their real estate goals. Prior to launching my real estate career, I worked as a Software Developer.  At times I managed other software developers, while at other times I was the lead developer on a project.  During that period of my career, I worked on some very, very big projects, as well as some tiny projects. At Intel, I learned 2 important things.  #1, was how to do the right thing right.  Stated in a longer winded way, it's sometimes apparent what the right thing to do is, but it's often difficult to buckle down and do it that way.  And #2, was how to be excessively direct.  I'm still working on unlearning #2.  Bear with me.  I had 8 years of training. I started my professional career at American Express where I was part of a lead developer on a team that developed over 1,000,000 lines of highly reusable code.  For the early 1990's, this was an incredible accomplishment. Specialties: Coffee, software, social media"

The use of Test Driven Development (TDD) gives us assurance that any changes we make do not break existing business rules and our software continues to grow with the business. However, the use of TDD is only effective if we have good coverage. How do we ensure that this is achieved throughout the team?. The use of Continous integrations tools like jenkins and sonar give visual metrics on coverage and adherence to standards. How do we make sure that teams are adhering to SOLID OO Principles?. Peer review and practices like pairing help in distributing knowledge in the team. How do we make sure that the more experienced developers are passing knowledge to the less experienced developers?. Again practices like pairing, peer review and formal mentoring help in bringing the less experienced developers up to speed. Do actively managed teams perform better than self managing teams?. Software development is a creative field and everybody in a team should have a voice, let the team leader be a mediator instead of a manager. Be a manager only when really necessary. Create ownership in the team. Every software project is a work of art, the only difference is that it is alive and contines to grow with time. I have been in the software development field professionally since end of 2005. In this time I have had the opportunity to use practices and tools I have mentioned above and become a big champion of them. Small bad practices like hard coding the location of a file can cost the client a lot of money in the long run.

I enjoy writing highly efficient and safe code that uses elegant algorithms and architecture. In past, I have worked with many different languages, including FORTRAN for computational physics and Python for general purpose programming. Nowadays, I use Go for back-end development and Rust for systems development. Both of these languages are fast and versatile. They also require a challenging thinking model, which I find appealing. 2) I can apply base principles and systematic approach for problem solving. As a Physics major I have developed problem solving skills that can be applied to any field. Physics taught me to dissect any big question into smaller, digestible problems, and then apply fundamental knowledge to solve  them. 3) I strongly believe that communication is the key. I have lead a small team of aspiring software developers to create and deploy commercial IT projects. It is how I learned the importance of communication. 4) Multilingual. I am fluent in English, Russian and Kazakh. 5) Math Skills. I am proficient with math as a result of my Physics training. I can solve multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, complex analysis and statistics problems. But more importantly, I know how to transform a real-life problem into a set of mathematical equations, which I can solve using above-mentioned math skills. 6) I am inventor at heart. Despite my natural science background, I am inclined towards creative processes. Whether it is programming, physics or everyday tasks, I relish in discovering non-conventional approaches and solutions."
